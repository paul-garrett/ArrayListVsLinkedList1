# ArrayListVsLinkedList1

An ArrayList is faster than a LinkedList for every operation except for inserting or removing from either end of the list.

	In this example the program is adding to the front of the list, so LinkedList executes faster.

	NOTE: The program takes several seconds to execute, so you will have to wait for the results.
